# KMD_Lipid_Study
Study of the utility of the Kendrick Mass Defect to identify unknown compounds in metabolomics. 

The goal of this project is to calculate the Kendrick Mass (KM) and Kendrick Mass Defect (KMD) of the compounds of the CEU Mass Mediator (CMM) database, analyse them based on the patterns formed by the distinct lipid families, and obtain supplementary information on the two-dimensional formula of the missing metabolites. The CMM database is formed by the integration of compounds from the main metabolomic databases for a subsequent detection of potential missing metabolites. The KM and KMD are used to identify homologous compounds differing only by a number of CH2 units, this article will exploit this to graphically detect the gaps in a proposed set of lipid families and the expected metabolites in these gaps. The data is first processed through a mass scale based on the CH2 radical; whose mass is defined as 14.0000 mass units. This gives place to the assignation of the same KMD to ions that differ in one or more CH2 groups, which in term permits us to have a preliminary assignment of putative annotations to formulas obtained by MS that do not have a match in the database.
